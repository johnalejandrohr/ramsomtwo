# RansomTwo Project README

RansomTwo is a ransomware codebase created for educational purposes. It serves as a learning tool to understand the mechanics of ransomware attacks. Please note that certain harmful functionalities have been intentionally omitted to ensure responsible use in educational settings.

This README provides detailed instructions on how to clone the RansomTwo project, create a virtual environment, and set up the necessary dependencies to run the project successfully.

## Clone the Project

First, clone the project from the GitHub repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/ramsomtwo.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd ramsomtwo
```

## Create a Virtual Environment

Next, create a virtual environment for the project using `python-venv`:

```bash
python -m venv ramsomtwo-env
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment (Linux)

To activate the virtual environment on Linux, use the following command:

```bash
source ramsomtwo-env/bin/activate
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment (Windows)

On Windows, execute the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```bash
ramsomtwo-env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

## Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary dependencies using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If you are downloading and installing the project for the first time, the above command will install the necessary dependencies. If you have already installed new dependencies and want to update the `requirements.txt` file, execute the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to work on the RansomTwo project! If you have any questions or issues, feel free to reach out to us.
